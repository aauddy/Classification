Almost every individual has a credit card and a correct usage of it does really help in building a good credit score. 
How important is Credit score? Ask anyone â€“ specially here in US and all will know it. However, one default payment 
can cause the credit score to plummet. Not only credit score, it also has an adverse effect on the credit limit and 
future loans of any kind.
In this project, we would be dealing with a case of customer default payments in Taiwan. The dataset has 24 features and 
a class label and there are 30000 instances. We would be creating a predictive model to let the bank predict that whether 
their customer would be a defaulter for the next payment or not.
